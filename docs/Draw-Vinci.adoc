== Introduction

[#portErrors]
.MakeBlock XY Plotter + XMC4500
image::hw.png[]

=== Project Description

[quote]
Design and develop both a multi-threaded PC GUI application as well as an XMC RTOS application using uCOS-III to control a MakeBlock XY plotter as shown below. In
either case you can select a file format (G-Code, Excellon, HPGL or SVG — see below) to determine the content that shall be drawn using the machine. As an
alternative you could devise a simple drawing application to do the same.

== Formats supported

=== Images

Here is the subset of SVG parameters supported and recognised when opening, importing or saving:

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
| width    | Width of display
| height   | Height of display
| viewbox  | Dimensions of view
| rect     | Rectangles
| ellipse  | Ellipses
| circle   | Circles
| polyline | Group of lines
| polygone | Polygones
| path     | Paths
| text     | Texts
| transform| Just the translation matrix is supported til now

|===

[NOTE]
====
Colors not supported!

=== G-CODE Specification

Here is the subset of G-CODE currently supported

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
|G28 | Perform homing routine
|G90 | Absolute mode positioning
|G91 | Relative mode positioning
|G01 | Linear interpolation
|G02 | Circular interpolation

|===

Possible commands:

. #G28$             : Plotter will move to its (0, 0) position and stop there.
. #G90$             : Plotter will interprete all subsequent commands as absolute movements.
. #G91$             : Plotter will interprete all subsequent commands as relative to the current position.
. #G01:XA:YB$       : Plotter will move linearly to the point (A, B) - relative or absolute.
. #G01:ZK$          : Plotter's pen will be dropped (K = 1) or lifted up (K = 0).
. #G02:XA:YB:IC:JD$ : Plotter will move in a circular way to the point (A, B), taking as reference the center at (A+C, B+D) - relative or absolute.

=== Scaling & Resolution

Using baudrate of 75000 for the spi, the following mesurements were found for the various step mode:

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
|FULL_STEP      | (2010, 1728)
|HALF_STEP      | (4020, 3456)
|QUARTER_STEP   | (8035, 6907)
|EIGHTH_STEP    | (16061, 13806)
|SIXTEENTH_STEP | (32107, 27607)

|===

The ratio of steps measured is ~1,1633, i.e. HEIGHT_STEP = ~0,86*WIDTH_STEP. The canvas where the user can draw something has the dimension: 555px X 477px,
accounting for a ratio of ~1,1635.

In effect, every point (x, y) in canvas, will be scaled as follows:

    - x_to_plot = x . (WIDTH_STEP/CANVAS_WIDTH)
    - y_to_plot = y . (WIDTH_STEP/CANVAS_WIDTH)

so that for the point (0, 0) in GUI, the plotter will receive (0, 0) and
for the point (555, 477), the plotter will receive (WIDTH_STEP, ~0,86*WIDTH_STEP).

==== Draw Tab

===== Drawing Tools

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
| Eraser     | Remove elements of canvas.
| Freehand   | Permits to draw in a free style.
| Line       | Used to draw lines.
| Square     | Used to draw squares.
| Rectangle  | Used to draw rectangles.
| Polygone   | Used to draw polygones.
| Select     | Permits to select items on canvas. When selected, an item can be removed clicking 'del' on the keyboard.
| Magnifier  | Permits zoom in using a user-defined rectangle. With the left button of the mouse, the user can define a rectangle to zoom in and with the right click of
the mouse, the user can zoom out completely to the default scale.
| Text       | Used to write a text on canvas. Although this still cannot be plotted!
| Circle     | Used to draw circles.
| Ellipse    | Used to draw ellipses.
| Import     | Used to import to canvas the current image on the nextSVGButton.

|===

==== Control Tab

===== Control Tools

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
| Manual & Auto       | The mode should be set before pressing play to start a new permanent connection with the plotter.
| PromptEdit          | Using the promptEdit the user can send single messages onto the XMC4500.
| Mini Terminal       | Terminal displays the messages sent within manual mode onto xmc4500. Besides, it always display the incoming messages from xmc4500.
| Directional Buttons | The user can manually control the motors when in manual mode.
| Pen Button          | The user can manually control the pen position when in manual mode.
| Clear Terminal      | It will clear the mini terminal completely.

|===

Mode::
    Manual:::
        In this mode one can use the directional and pen buttons to control the plotter.
    Auto:::
        In this mode one can generate g-code automatically when pressing the play  button. A progress bar will show the progress of the plotting. Using the pause
        button, the user can always pause the current plotting and use the flow control buttons to step through the g-code commands and plot the next or previous
        commands.

== XMC4500

.Servo Motor Function
video::servoMotor.mp4[width=640]

=== Algorithm

Any time the XMC4500 receives something through its UART channel, it gets interrupted. The message is then read and forwarded onto the 'AppTaskCom' task. This task
will check the message for protocol compliance and interpret the content. The 'AppTaskCom' task will finally send the interpreted message (now in the form of a
structure) to the 'AppTaskPlot' task, that will execute the command received. 
When the 'AppTaksPlot' is done with the g-code command it will send an acknowledge message. If a '#GX:...$' is sent, then the microcontroller will send at completion
the string: '#GX:DONE$'.

== Communication

The communication between GUI and the XMC4500 happens through UART, using the following scheme as protocol.

=== Protocol

[protocol_frame]
.Protocol Frame
image::frame.png[Frame of Protocol]

Where:

[lowerroman]
 . *#*: Beginn of message;
 . *G COMMAND*: One of the supported G-Code commands [vide following section];
 . *ARG{1}*: a apropriate argument to the G command;
 . *ARG{2}*: another apropriate argument to the G command;
 . *$*: End of message;

[NOTE]
====
The number of arguments in a message should conform to the G command
