== Introduction

[#portErrors]
.MakeBlock XY Plotter

=== Project Description

[quote]
Design and develop both a multi-threaded PC GUI application as well as an XMC RTOS application using uCOS-III to control a MakeBlock XY plotter as shown below. In
either case you can select a file format (G-Code, Excellon, HPGL or SVG — see below) to determine the content that shall be drawn using the machine. As an
alternative you could devise a simple drawing application to do the same.

== GUI

=== Scaling & Resolution

Using baudrate of xxx for the spi, the following mesurements were found for the various step mode:

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
|FULL_STEP      | (2010, 1728)
|HALF_STEP      | (4020, 3456)
|QUARTER_STEP   | (8035, 6907)
|EIGHTH_STEP    | (16061, 13806)
|SIXTEENTH_STEP | (32107, 27607)

|===

The ratio of steps measured is ~1,1633, i.e. HEIGHT_STEP = ~0,86*WIDTH_STEP. The canvas where the user can draw something has the dimension: 555px X 477px,
accounting for a ratio of ~1,1635.

In effect, every point (x, y) in canvas, will be scaled as follows:

    - x_to_plot = x . (WIDTH_STEP/CANVAS_WIDTH)
    - y_to_plot = y . (WIDTH_STEP/CANVAS_WIDTH)

so that for the point (0, 0) in GUI, the plotter will receive (0, 0) and
for the point 555,477, the plotter will receive (WIDTH_STEP, ~0,86*WIDTH_STEP).

=== Functionalities

Key Combinations::
    Ctrl+N:::
        Clear canvas for new work.
    Ctrl+O:::
        Opens new SVG file.
    Ctrl+S:::
        Save current canvas.
    Ctrl+Shift+S:::
        Save current canvas with a new name.
    Ctrl+?:::
        Opens about dialog.
    Ctrl+Z:::
        Remove last added item from canvas. 
    Del:::
        Remove selected item from canvas.

==== Menus

. **File**
    .. New: clean canvas and start new project.
    .. Open: opens a svg file.
    .. Save: saves canvas to already saved file or calls save as if still not saved.
    .. Save As: saves canvas with a new name.
    .. Quit: closes app.
. **Settings**
    .. Svg Directory: define the directory to import the svg's from when using the import tool.
    .. Step Motor: define the step resolution, according to section 'Scaling & Resolution'.
. **Help**
    .. About: basic info about this app.
    
==== Draw Tab

===== Tools

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
| Eraser     | Increase opacity of item clicked upon. If clicking until item dissapear, it will make the item invisible.
| Freehand   | Permits to draw in a free style.
| Line       | Used to draw lines.
| Square     | Used to draw squares.
| Rectangle  | Used to draw rectangles.
| Polygone   | Used to draw polygones.
| Select     | Permits to select items on canvas. When selected, an item can be removed clicking 'del' on the keyboard.
| Magnifier  | Permits zoom in using a user-defined rectangle. With the left button of the mouse, the user can define a rectangle to zoom in and with the right click of
the mouse, the user can zoom out completely to the default scale.
| Text       | Used to write a text on canvas. Although this still cannot be plotted!
| Circle     | Used to draw circles.
| Ellipse    | Used to draw ellipses.
| Import     | Used to import to canvas the current image on the nextSVGButton.

|===

==== Control Tab

===== Connection

PromptEdit::
    Terminal:::
        Terminal displays the messages sent within manual mode onto xmc4500. Besides, it always display the incoming messages from xmc4500.

===== Mode

Manual::
    Directional & Pen Buttons:::
        In this mode one can use the directional and pen buttons to control the plotter.

Auto:::
    Flow Control Buttons:::
        In this mode one can generate g-code automatically when pressing the play  button. A progress bar will show the progress of the plotting. Using the pause
        button, the user can always pause the current plotting and use the flow control buttons to step through the g-code commands and plot the next or previous
        commands.

=== Formats supported

=== Images

Here is the subset of SVG parameters supported and recognised when opening, importing or saving:

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
| width    | Width of display
| height   | Height of display
| viewbox  | Dimensions of view
| rect     | Rectangles
| ellipse  | Ellipses
| circle   | Circles
| polyline | Group of lines
| polygone | Polygones
| path     | Paths
| text     | Texts
| transform| Just the translation matrix is supported til now

|===

[NOTE]
====
Colors not supported!

== Communication

The communication between GUI and the uC XMC4500 happens through UART, using the followins scheme as protocol:

[protocol_frame]
.Protocol Frame
image::frame.png[Frame of Protocol]

Where:

[lowerroman]
 . *#*: Beginn of message;
 . *G COMMAND*: One of the supported G-Code commands [vide following section];
 . *ARG{1}*: a apropriate argument to the G command;
 . *ARG{2}*: another apropriate argument to the G command;
 . *$*: End of message;

[NOTE]
====
The number of arguments in a message should conform to the G command

====

=== G-CODE Specification

Here is the subset of G-CODE currently supported

[cols="^.1s,<.3m"]
|===
|G28 | Perform homing routine
|G90 | Absolute mode positioning
|G91 | Relative mode positioning
|G01 | Linear interpolation
|G02 | Circular interpolation

|===

Possible commands:

. #G28$             : Plotter will move to the top-left side.
. #G90$             : Plotter will interprete all subsequent commands as absolute movements.
. #G91$             : Plotter will interprete all subsequent commands as relative to the current position.
. #G01:XA:YB$       : Plotter will move linearly to the point (A, B) - relative or absolute.
. #G01:ZK$          : Plotter's pen will lift up (K = 1) or drop (K = 0).
. #G02:XA:YB:IC:JD$ : Plotter will move in a circular way to the point (A, B), taking as reference the center at (A+C, B+D) - relative or absolute.
